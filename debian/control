Description: module for determining image sizes in several common formats
 Image::Size is a Perl module capable of determining image sizes from several
 common formats. It handles XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, PNG, MNG, the PPM family of
 formats (PPM/PGM/PBM), TIFF, FlashMX (Shockwave Flash version 6), WMF/EMF,
 and more.
 .
 It supports additional file types through Image::Magick, and the included
 "imgsize" script provides access to Image::Size from the shell.
